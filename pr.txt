## Description
This PR implements comprehensive User Profile and Balance Management features as requested in Issue #35. It introduces a robust system for tracking user stats, a daily login bonus with streak mechanics, and transaction history.

## Changes Created
- **Database Schema**:
  - Added `nickname`, `avatarUrl`, `preferences`, `streak` to `User`.
  - Created `Transaction` model for auditing balance changes.
  - Cleaned up duplicate `Round` and `Prediction` models.
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/user/profile`: Full profile details.
  - `GET /api/user/balance`: Virtual balance check.
  - `GET /api/user/stats`: User game statistics.
  - `GET /api/user/transactions`: Paginated balance history (Bonuses, Wins, Losses).
  - `PATCH /api/user/profile`: Update profile settings.
  - `GET /api/user/:address/public-profile`: Public user view.
- **Logic**:
  - Implemented **Daily Login Bonus** in the auth flow:
    - Tracks consecutive logins.
    - Resets streak on missed days.
    - Awards multipliers (1.5x > 3 days, 2x > 7 days).

## Verification
- Checked logic for Streak calculation (Date diffing).
- Verified Schema consistency (although migration requires local DB).
- `docs/USER_MANAGEMENT_FEATURES.md` added with detailed implementation guide.

## Checklist
- [x] Schema updated
- [x] API Routes created
- [x] Daily Bonus logic implemented
- [x] Transaction history recording
- [x] Documentation added

Resolves #35
